We take your privacy seriously:
- No storage of personal information
- No recording or interception of audio/video streams 
- No persistence of chat messages
- All communication is peer-to-peer
- No server-side processing of media streams



## TODO 
- the app follows a mesh architecture for connecting the calls which is decent for 3-4 people but does not scale so well and puts extreme load on the users device for  <4 people in a call, so implement SFU

- add screen sharing

## note
coturn helps with NAT, and we are able to by pass most NATs and ISP's! even the super strict ones in India. if you find the call not working on any specific ISP or behind a very specific nat of FW feel free to drop a message
